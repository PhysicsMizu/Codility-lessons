    "Task description\n",
    "You have to climb up a ladder. The ladder has exactly N rungs, numbered from 1 to N. With each step, you can ascend by one or two rungs. More precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "with your first step you can stand on rung 1 or 2,\n",
    "if you are on rung K, you can move to rungs K + 1 or K + 2,\n",
    "finally you have to stand on rung N.\n",
    "Your task is to count the number of different ways of climbing to the top of the ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given N = 4, you have five different ways of climbing, ascending by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 1, 1 and 1 rung,\n",
