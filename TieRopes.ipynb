    "Task description\n",
    "There are N ropes numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose lengths are given in an array A, lying on the floor in a line. For each I (0 ≤ I < N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I].\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that two ropes I and I + 1 are adjacent. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot, and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied again.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given integer K, the goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is greater than or equal to K is maximal.\n",

    "For example, consider K = 4 and array A such that:\n",
